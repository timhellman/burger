# EAT DA BURGER
Homework, Unit 13 MVC by Tim Hellman

## SUMMARY  
Eat Da Burger is an application that allows users to enter the names of hamburger varieties in a searchbar labeled "Burger Name".   Upon being entering the burger name and clicking "Add Burger!", that entry is put under a column labeled "Burgers That Are Not Devoured!"  Below each entry in that column is a "Devour!" button, which - once pressed by the user - will send that particular burger to a column labeled "Burgers That Are Devoured!"

## INSTALLATION
This app has the following dependencies: dotenv, mysql, express, and express-handlebars.  Run ```npm install``` and ```npm init```

## CONTRIBUTING
I worked on this project with classmates Kevin Fujimoto and Blake The Quake and tutor Chad Tao.
